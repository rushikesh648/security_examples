# 🛡️ Project Name: Core Security Implementations

## 💡 Overview

This repository serves as a practical demonstration and collection of core code implementations for preventing common cyber threats, with a primary focus on securing user authentication and application transactions.

The goal is to showcase best practices in secure coding and defensive measures against cyber fraud, data breaches, and injection attacks.

## 🚀 Key Implementations

| Feature | Description | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Password Hashing** | Securely stores user passwords using the recommended **bcrypt** algorithm with proper salting. | ✅ Implemented |
| **Transaction Fraud Checks** | Elementary logic to detect suspicious financial activity (e.g., high-velocity transactions). | ✅ Implemented |
| **Input Validation** | Code examples for sanitizing user inputs to prevent XSS and SQL injection. | 🚧 In Progress |
| **Multi-Factor Auth (MFA)** | Logic for integrating a time-based one-time password (TOTP) system. | 💡 Planned |

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Language:** Python (for backend logic demonstration)
* **Security Libraries:** `bcrypt`, `werkzeug.security` (or similar)
* **Concepts:** Salting, Hashing, Velocity Checking, Input Sanitization

## Installation and Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/rushikesh648/security_examples](https://github.com/rushikesh648/security_examples)
cd security_examples
```
#####
2. Install Dependencies
If you are using the password hashing examples, you will need the bcrypt library:

```Bash

pip install bcrypt
```
3. Running the Examples
Each main security concept is typically demonstrated in its own Python file (e.g., hash_passwords.py, transaction_checker.py). Execute them directly:

```Bash

python hash_passwords.py
```
